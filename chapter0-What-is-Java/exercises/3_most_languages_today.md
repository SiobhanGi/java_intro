# Compiled languages
Examples are: c++, c#, c, haskell, go, Erlang, Rust

Advantage:
- faster performance (greater execution speed) directly using the native code of the target machine.
- can apply powerful optimatizations during the compile stage.
- Used when efficency is a concern (games)
- more control over hardware such as cpu usage and memory.


Disadvantage: OS depepentant based off machine it was compiled on. Stricter coding style,



# Interpreted languages
Examples are: javascript, python, ruby, php,

Advantage:
- dynamic language
- dynamically typed
- Not OS depepentant
- Do not need to recompile when want to make a small change, easier to debug
- smaller exe size,
- dynamic development(e.g meta-programming)
- preferred choice for AI since programs have to adapt during runtime to new stimuli.
- just-in-time compilation which increases speed so it's just as fast as a compiled language.

Disadvantage:

Slower execution speed because program is converted into machine code at runtime.
