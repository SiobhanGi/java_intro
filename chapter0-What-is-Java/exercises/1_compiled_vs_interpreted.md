Compiled language (Compile-link-execute)

Code is written in a high level language (source code), the compiler converts
the source code into low level language (machine code).

The low level code is called an object. A collection of objects are linked together
to create a program. Link errors can occur during the linking of objects due to a
communication problem.

The linked objects become an executable. The OS stores the executable into RAM in order
to run the program.

Compiled programs are OS dependant to the platform they were compiled on.


Interpreted language

Code evaluated line by line by a repl which handles the execution of the programme
rather then the OS itself.

Intepreted languages are independant of OS.
